# Notes Web Application üìù
It is a basic Web Application created using Flask for adding new notes to their account and also deleting any existing notes from the account. 
The notes can be only accessed when the user logs in with their email and password. Any number of users can use this web application and their notes are secured and can only be accessed through their unique account details.

Every new user can create an account through the sign-up page. Once the account is created, the user can log in to their account by providing the details and after logging in the user can start adding their notes. The User can log out and when logged back they can still have access to saved notes until they delete the note. 

The Front end part is developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, **Jinja2** templating, and a little bit of **Javascript**. <br />
The back end part is developed using **Flask**, **Python**, and **SQLAlchemy** is used for database management.
